## Overview

In the highly competitive web design space, telling a client you can build a great website isn't enough; you have to show them. The goal for **connorlove.com** was to create a digital environment that immediately establishes trust, technical authority, and design proficiency.

The project began in Figma, where we mapped out a highly modern, minimalist user interface. We focused heavily on typography, whitespace, and a grid system that would feel premium and breathable. The design phase also included mapping out complex scroll interactions and micro-animations to keep the user engaged without feeling overwhelmed.

During development, the focus shifted entirely to performance and execution. Heavy, bloated animations were avoided in favor of clean, performant CSS and Javascript transitions that render at a flawless 60 frames per second. The site is fully responsive, ensuring that the premium experience translates perfectly from massive desktop monitors down to mobile devices.

The final result is a lightning-fast, highly interactive portfolio that not only houses our previous work, but stands as a flagship case study of its own.
